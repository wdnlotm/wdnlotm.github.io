As such, some notable top- ics usually covered in universities are not included in this book (trigonometric substitution, for example). However, it is nonetheless a very handy tool for university students as well. There are no ”instructional” sections in this book. It is all problem-and- solution; however, someone who is most comfortable learning by example may find they can learn just from this book alone. The solutions assume mastery of content covered in the previous chapters (ex: differentiating u to find du will not be explained in the integration chapters. Nonetheless, the solutions are all extremely thorough in their explanations and should be easy to follow. The problems here are designed to be more difficult than AP questions. But with this increase in difficulty, anyone who fully works through this book will be extremely well prepared for the exam and should expect a very good score. However, working through the ENTIRE book is quite a task, and some selected problems from each chapter should do a good job as well. Note: This book is designed to be a workbook, ie. the margins between prob- lems are there for you to solve them in the space. Good luck on your exam prep!
